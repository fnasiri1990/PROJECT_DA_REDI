# PROJECT_DA_REDI
This is my project about Global pollution which I have done it for my ReDI School course
How have global air pollution levels changed over time? Are there any noticeable trends or patterns? 
Regional Comparison: Which regions or countries have the highest and lowest levels of air pollution? 
Are there any significant differences between regions? Seasonal Variations: How does air pollution vary throughout the year? Are there any seasonal trends or fluctuations?  How do pollution levels differ between urban and rural areas? Correlation Analysis: Are there any correlations between air pollution levels and other factors such as population density, industrial activity, or transportation infrastructure? Health Impact Assessment: Can you analyze the potential health impacts of air pollution based on available data? Are there any regions with particularly concerning levels of pollution in terms of public health? Policy Evaluation: How effective have past policies or interventions been in reducing air pollution? Can you identify any successful strategies or areas for improvement? Predictive Modeling: Can you develop a predictive model to forecast future air pollution levels based on historical data and relevant predictors? Data Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends in the dataset, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and interpret the data.
